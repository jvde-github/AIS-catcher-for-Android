# AIS-catcher for Android - A multi-platform AIS receiver 
This Android App is a dual channel AIS receiver that can be used to pick up AIS signals from nearby vessels even if offline using a cheap USB radtio receier, like a RTL-SDR dongle, Airspy Mini, Airspy R2, Airspy HF+ or input RTL-TCP. 
Output is send in the form of NMEA messages to either screen or broadcasted over UDP so that it can be easily picked up and displayed by apps like [Boat Beacon](https://pocketmariner.com/mobile-apps/boatbeacon/) 
or send to Marine services like Marinetraffic.

The requirements to recieve AIS signals are a RTL-SDR dongle (or Airspy), a simple antenna, an Android device with USB connector and an OTG cable to connect the dongle with your Android device.

For testing purposes you can download a [APK file from my Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HDm39szX_kF-Bg6KKruabFoWmzveji0w/view?usp=sharing) (I might have to give you access). After downloading the file on your phone, just tap to install. After that you should be good to go. Feedback is very much appreciated by mailing [me](mailto:jvde.github@gmail.com) or sharing in the issue section, before I will share this app in the Play Store!

For a video of a field test of an early version [see YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn-3c-qCxu4). Hopefully in the App store by the end of this Summer.

More to come....
